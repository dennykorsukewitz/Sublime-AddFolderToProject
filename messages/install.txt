⭐ Congratulations ⭐

**AddFolderToProject** is a Sublime Text package that streamlines the process of adding and removing folders to and from your projects. It provides a set of commands and context menu options to manage your project's folder structure directly from the editor.

    Of course, you can use the already built-in function (Project -> Add Folder to Project...).
    But then you have to click through all the folders again and again.

Enjoy!
