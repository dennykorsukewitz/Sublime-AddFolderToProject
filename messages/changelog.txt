Version 2.0.0
- Updated README.md.
- [Fixed] Captions conflict
- Added / Updated and Refactored (old) Functions
    - Add Folder to Project: This function provides a searchable list of folders that can be added to the current project. The list consists of absolute paths and recursive paths.
    - Remove Folder from Project: This function provides a list of active folders in the project, that can be removed from the current project.
    - Add Custom Folder to Project: This function allows you to add a custom folder (absolute path) to the project.
    - Add this Folder to Project: This function adds the folder of the current open file to the project.
    - Remove this Folder from Project: This function removes the folder of the current open file from the project.
    - Create Project from File: This function creates a new project (new sublime window) with the folder of the current open file.
    - Copy File Path: This function copies the file path of the current open file.
    - Copy Dir Path: This function copies the directory path of the current open file.

Version 1.1.1
- Corrected behavior with no project already opened.

Version 1.1.0
- Fixed menu item visibility with file without a physical path
- If there is no physical paths now the plugin asks for a custom path
- If a directory already exists in the project it won't be shown in the list dialog
- If the file's directory already exists in the project in the left click menu you'll now see not the "add this folder to project" but a new more useful "remove this folder from project". Quite self-explaining, I think.
- Now you can create a blank new project starting from the opened file with the command (in the Ctrl+Shift+P Menu) "Create Project from File". This command will open a new sublime window with a new project containing only the file's directory. *I can't try it under OsX* so I just copied two lines of code from another project (thanks to the SideBarEnhancements sublime plugin). *OsX Users: can you please tell me if it works?!*. This will be really appreciated.

Version 1.0.0
- First Release
